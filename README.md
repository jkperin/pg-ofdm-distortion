# Analytical modeling of intermodulation distortion in OFDM signals for IM-DD systems

> Code, thesis, and publications from undergraduate thesis written at Federal University of Espirito Santo in 2012-2013.

Undergraduate thesis and accompanying code were written in Portuguese. Papers were written in English.

Some functions were implemented in C++ in order to minimize runtime. Before using these functions, they must be compiled with the mex function from Matlab.
